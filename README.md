# firefly-cam

Because the USB microscope image is mirrored when using Photo Booth on MacOS, and because this stupid application has no option to mirror the view, I created this website. It is installable as a PWA (Progressive Web Application) for offline use.

The software was designed to facilitate counting of firefly larvae at the [Bring Back The Light](https://bringbackthelight.org) project in Bali.
